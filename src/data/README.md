# Data Access Layer

This directory contains the data access layer components for the AQ Chat application. It provides an abstraction layer between the application's business logic and the underlying data storage.

## Purpose

- Centralizes database operations and queries
- Provides consistent interfaces for data access
- Separates data access concerns from business logic
- Makes the application more maintainable and testable

## Structure

The data access layer interacts primarily with MongoDB through Mongoose models and provides type-safe interfaces for database operations.
