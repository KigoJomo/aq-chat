# ü§ñ AQ-Chat

*Because talking to humans is overrated anyway.*

## What is this?

AQ-Chat is a sleek, modern AI chatbot application built with Next.js that lets you have conversations with an AI assistant. It's like having a friend who actually listens to you, never gets tired, and doesn't steal your leftovers from the fridge.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Clean, intuitive UI** - Even your grandma could use it (maybe)
- **Markdown support** - For when plain text is just too... plain
- **Code highlighting** - With syntax highlighting and copy functionality, because typing out code is for masochists
- **Authentication** - Keep your embarrassing AI conversations private
- **Responsive design** - Chat from your phone while pretending to work

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - For that sweet, sweet server-side rendering
- **React 19** - Because we like our components like we like our coffee: functional
- **TypeScript** - For catching errors before they catch you
- **Zustand** - State management without the boilerplate drama
- **Clerk** - Authentication that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out
- **Tailwind CSS** - Because writing custom CSS in 2023+ is like churning your own butter
